# Exploring-Log-RGB-Data-for-Image-Classification-Reproducibility-Study-
Reproduced and validated the findings of a study comparing JPG (sRGB), Linear RGB, and Log RGB image formats in CNN-based binary classification. Implemented and tested FishNet64, ResNet18 (modified), and DenseNet121, confirming that Log and Linear RGB formats improve model accuracy.
